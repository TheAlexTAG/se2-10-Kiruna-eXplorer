# Technical Debt Strategy

## Introduction

This document outlines our plan for identifying, addressing, and preventing technical debt during development, in order to ensure the long-term quality and maintainability of our project.

## Planning and Prioritization

### **1. Identifying Debt**
- **Tools:** We rely on tools like **SonarQube** to identify technical debt issues, including code smells, security vulnerabilities, and maintainability problems.
- **Severity:** Issues are categorized by severity (e.g., critical, major, minor), with higher priority given to critical and major issues.
- **Complexity and Impact:** Simpler issues that are quick to fix will be deprioritized if they don't significantly impact the system.

### **2. Prioritization Framework**
- **Reliability First:** Priority is given to reliability issues that impact system stability or user experience.
- **Security Considerations:** Security hotspots, especially those affecting sensitive data (if any), are addressed immediately.
- **Deferring Low-Impact Issues:** Code duplication and other minor issues are scheduled for future iterations.

## Integration with Sprint Activities

### **1. During Sprints**
- **Pre-Sprint Planning:**
  - Allocate **2-3 hours** to review SonarQube reports.
  - Assign identified tasks based on complexity and familiarity with the code.
  - Group minor issues into a single task for efficiency.
- **Ongoing Development:**
  - Include code quality checks in pull requests.
  - Use linters and code reviews to catch potential debt early.

### **2. Post-Sprint Review**
- Dedicate **1-2 hours** for the team to:
  - Reassess the impact of unresolved issues.
  - Plan fixes for critical problems introduced during the sprint.

## Workflow for Managing Debt

1. **Task Creation:**
   - Create separate tasks for critical issues.
   - Combine small, related issues into grouped tasks to save time.

2. **Assignment:**
   - Assign tasks based on team members' familiarity with the affected code (each member still decides for theselves which tasks to take).
   - Balance workload by distributing tasks evenly across the team.

3. **Debt Reduction Workflow:**
   - Focus on one critical issue per sprint.
   - Tackle grouped minor issues as part of team goals for incremental improvement.

## Prevention Measures

- **Quality Gates:** Integrate SonarQube quality gates into CI/CD pipelines to block merges that introduce critical issues.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Enforce consistent coding standards through automated tools.
  - Regular code reviews to identify potential debt before it accumulates.
- **Learning and Improvement:**
  - Share insights from resolved issues to avoid similar problems in the future.

## Long-Term Strategy

We aim to reduce technical debt incrementally, prioritizing critical issues while balancing feature development, in order to, over time, ensure a maintainable and robust codebase.
